# "Zak Truk Fitness"
## Description/Motivation

Create an mobile app that would provide fitness tips, excercises, info about different machines and what muscles they target, provide safety instructions for when working out, provide users with a more streamlined fitness app that doesn't have pay walls, and have access to tutorials on the excercises if the user needs more instruction. It would ideally have many different screens, links to the tutorials, and a UI that is accessible for everyone.

## Concept

### Scope
In scope would be to contain different pages containing different instructions and information on the different excercies, hyperlinks to excercise tutorials, hyperlinks to meal recipes, feature a safety page, and ways to track progess (will update once futher along). Out-of-scope would be most likely extensive account creation system as of right now. A stakeholder could anticipate an account system in the long run as once more personalized features were implemented, it would require the storage specific to the user and not the base app that would appear everytime. 

### Vision
Providing an easy to use workout application that will be accessible to all, for free, in hopes of creating a healthy lifestyle for larger portions of society. I strive to provide accurate information, proper resources, and continued updates to ensure that the app is constantly evolving and improving over the course of the semester.
