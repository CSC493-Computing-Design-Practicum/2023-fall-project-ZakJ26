The below screen captures are from the app version I used for the Midterm presentation. In the version I'm using for the final, there is a lot more code, however not all of it is complete. 

The below code is the ChatGPT experimental extension, which has text-to-speech and voice input capabilities, as well as text bar for the user to search.

The next code screenshots are for the At-Home workout and Arm workout areas, respectively. Which has timers for each excercise for the user to track time doing the exercise, with the timer number visualy changing, a start button to begin the timers, and a button to reset all of the timers for the user to go again.

The next screenshot is of the main menu code, which has the navigations to all the different pages, user can long click and see a description of the page before actually entering, as well as color-responsiveness to user touch for accessibility

Lastly, the screenshot is for the step counter which has an active text area that changes as the user walks for their step count and estimated calories burned from steps, as well as buttons to start, stop, and reset both counters
