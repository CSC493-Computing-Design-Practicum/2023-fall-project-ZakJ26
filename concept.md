## Goals:
To provide users with a mobile application to aid in excercising, whether that be at home or in the gym, give nutrional tips,
and contain safety information. It would also be a free to use app that doesn't have it's content locked behind pay walls. 

## Context:
The proposed project gives me a chance to create a rapid prototype of an app that would benefit people who workout. From athletes
to average Joes, everyone would be able to find some form of excercise all within the app. I've tried tons of different Workout 
applications, and most times they have bad UI's or require you to pay to get to more than just the most basic of functions. Such as
Fitness22's Workout Tracker app [https://fitness22.com/our-apps/] requiring you to pay for usage.

## Novelty: 
I propose a way to pick through specific targeted areas for excercises, have pre-built workout plans, provide meal recipes for different
nutrional goals, nutrional tips, and ideally, a way to track your water intake and calories. 

## Audience:
The expected audience would be people who workout, and the expected outcome would be that they would be able to get all the features
mentioned above in a free application. 

## Challenges: 
Some of the biggest challenges I found while working on the project came from the software I used itself. It made it uploading the different code sections more annoying and time consuming because App Inventor would not let my simply do push/pull requests on GitHub so I had to take different screenshots and type out comments in the different files describing the code and what its doing. I also had wanted to create a login system in order to create personalized experiences, however due to lack of documentation, it made it very hard and once I got it working (kind of), it would have required me to completely rearrange my pages to make the login be the first screen.

## Measures:
As I worked through my project, I stuck pretty closely to following the future goals I laid out in my weekly reports and I used that to gauge my accomplishments over the course of the semester. 

## Motivation: 
This porject is important to me because I enjoy working out and being healthy. It will coincide with a weight loss journey of mine
and I plan on using my app through the course of capstone, not only as a project but also for its intended purpose of helping people working out.
I selected this because I really enjoyed my time in Building Better Apps and really wanted to see what I could accomplish with a lot of time to dedicate
to a singular project. I hope that it will help me understand app development on a higher level and also practicing human centered 
computing design. 

## Possible Extensions:
Creating a way to scan barcodes of food you've eaten and it track it throughout the day until its cleared,
AI integration in some form
