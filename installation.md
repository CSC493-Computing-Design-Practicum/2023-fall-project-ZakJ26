The initial step to install and use my project to first import the aia file from my repositiory to Mit App Inventor 2,
will then lead you to a screen like this one below.

Once you reach this screen, you will need to navigate to the connect menu in the top left of the screen, and select which method
you will be using to connect your mobile device. I recommend using the AI (App Inventor) Companion way, as it is the easiest.

You will then click on the AI Companion option, which will prompt you with this screen pop-up.

Before we move any further on the computer side. On your mobile Android device, you must have the MIT AI2 Companion app downloaded

You will then open the companion app and it will bring you to this screen. 
![Use code](https://github.com/CSC493-Computing-Design-Practicum/2023-fall-project-ZakJ26/assets/97726639/c55149f2-d0c8-4c98-baf6-27680301442f)

You will either then enter the code from the pop-up on the website or scan the QR code also on the pop-up to gain access to the app.
Once you have entered the correct coded, or scanned the QR, it will bring you to the main menu of the app

Which will give you full access to the app as you see fit, with all features available.
