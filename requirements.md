   -None
   -High, because if the information is false, it could potentially lead to issues and injuries
   -Continual (Adding and revising information regularly, grammar changes, and font switching)
2. Proper Function Of App Elements
   -Buttons, text bars, and other elements of the app perform their respective functions to give users the most effecient experience when working out
   -Using the MIT App Inventor Companion to use the app and go through and check to see if everything works as anticipated and debug based on what I found

   -High, because the app must function properly in order to be a quality app
   -September 27th, All of the elements I have work currently the way they are supposed to
  3.User Friendly UX
   -Give the user an that is easy to use and quick to learn in order to get them directly into using the app for its intended purpose
   -Conduct a heuristic analysis and attempt to display well-coded human centered computing
   -Main menu and primary side menus require the best UX, whereas info sides are less important due to needing less interaction
