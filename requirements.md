  # User Friendly UX
   -Give the user an that is easy to use and quick to learn in order to get them directly into using the app for its     intended purpose
   -Conduct a heuristic analysis and attempt to display well-coded human centered computing
   -Main menu and primary side menus require the best UX, whereas info sides are less important due to needing less interaction

   -Create and establish whether the info is differentiated or not between different profiles
   -The main features such as different selected workouts would be impacted, whereas Nutritional tips and Meals from the FitBot would stay the same 
   -If time persists
